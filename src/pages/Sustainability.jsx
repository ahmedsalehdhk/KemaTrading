        Kema Trading is committed to producing high-quality leather sustainably and with respect for the environment. We understand the need to preserve our planetâ€™s natural resources and reduce our
        environmental impact at every stage of production. For this reason, we use only low-impact chemicals and adopt sustainable production practices. We strive to reduce water and energy usage,
        minimize waste, and adopt innovative processing techniques to reduce our environmental impact. Additionally, we collaborate with our suppliers to ensure that even the raw materials used in the
        production of our leathers are sustainable and environmentally-friendly. We are committed to selecting only suppliers who adopt responsible production practices and are aligned with our
        sustainability values. We recognize that sustainability is an ongoing challenge and we are constantly seeking ways to improve our production and reduce our environmental impact.
